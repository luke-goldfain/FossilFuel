# Fossil Fuel

## Turn-based Couch-PVP Dinosaur Destruction!

**Description:**
Fossil Fuel pits two players against each other in strategic, off-the-rails combat. Players take turns moving the unit of their choice on a grid, then going into battle on a 2D cross-section of the map with destructible environments. The havoc you wreak in this physics-based combat will remain on the map and be visible as you plan your next move. Defeat your opponent's dinosaurs to claim victory and avoid becoming Fossil Fuel!
